# Insurance Decision Tree Analysis (Python)

This repository contains a Python-based decision tree analysis using insurance data. The project replicates and validates the results of a course assignment originally completed in RapidMiner, demonstrating the same analytical logic without relying on a visual workflow tool.

The work is structured around a series of assignment questions (**Q1–Q10**), each requiring specific data preparation steps and decision logic to arrive at correct classification outcomes. By implementing the same steps programmatically in Python, this project confirms understanding of the underlying decision tree concepts rather than tool-driven automation.

## Project Objectives

- Replicate a RapidMiner-based decision tree using Python  
- Validate assignment answers through code-based implementation  
- Demonstrate understanding of decision logic, rules, and outcomes  
- Produce equivalent outputs to those generated in RapidMiner
