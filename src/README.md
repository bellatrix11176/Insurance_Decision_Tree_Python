# Insurance Decision Tree Analysis (Python)

This repository contains a Python-based decision tree analysis using insurance data.
The project was created to replicate and validate the results of a course assignment
originally completed in RapidMiner, demonstrating the same analytical logic without
reliance on a visual workflow tool.

The work is structured around a series of assignment questions (Q1–Q10), each requiring
specific data preparation steps and decision logic to arrive at correct classification
outcomes. By implementing the same steps programmatically in Python, this project
confirms understanding of the underlying decision tree concepts rather than tool-driven
automation.

## Project Objectives
- Replicate a RapidMiner-based decision tree using Python
- Validate assignment answers through code-based implementation
- Demonstrate understanding of decision logic, rules, and outcomes
- Produce equivalent outputs to those generated in RapidMiner

## Tools Used
- Python

## Files Included
- CSV file containing the insurance dataset used for analysis
- Python script(s) implementing the decision tree logic
- Text-based menu tree output generated by the Python implementation

## Notes
This project emphasizes correctness, validation, and learning outcomes rather than
production-ready optimization. The focus is on reproducing analytical steps accurately
and demonstrating conceptual understanding of decision tree logic.

A related repository contains the original RapidMiner workflow used for the visual
implementation of this assignment.
